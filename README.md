# Minimal universal component example
Minimal example of the the universal component method using node, express and react.

The term [universal/isomorpic](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) has been around in the JavaScript community for some time. Where as a fully universal application will render the entire app on both server and client, universal component only renders specific components in both environments. This will allow us to get some of the gains from using a universal architecture without adding the complexity that a full SPA introduces.
